# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification App  
A Streamlit-based machine learning application for classifying brain MRI images into **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary**, or **No Tumor** using texture‑based features (GLCM + LBP) and an SVM classifier.

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project provides a lightweight, fast, and educational tool for analyzing brain MRI images.  
The system extracts texture features from the uploaded image and predicts the tumor class using a trained machine learning model.

✅ Built for research and learning  
✅ Fully local processing  
✅ Clean UI with explanations and insights  

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This application is not intended for medical diagnosis.  
> It is a research and educational tool only.
